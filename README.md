# RUNTRACK DATABASES & PYTHON
_A SQL query goes into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks, "Can I join you?"_

### DAY 01

During the session, several topics related to database management in MySQL were covered, including queries to filter, modify, delete and analyze data in the etudiant table of the laplateforme database. Here is an optimized summary of the work done:

**SQL queries:**

- Running advanced filters using WHERE, AND and LIKE, including specific searches such as students with names starting with a specific letter.

- Sorting results using ORDER BY in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) format.

**Data management:**

- Updating data using UPDATE commands, such as changing the age of a specific student.

- Controlled deletion of records with DELETE, using unique identifiers to avoid mass affectations.

**Statistics and analysis:**

- Calculation of the average age of students with AVG.

- Computation of the total number of students and specific groupings using COUNT.

- Retrieval of information about the youngest student using a combination of ORDER BY and LIMIT.

**Exporting results:**

- Use of SELECT INTO OUTFILE and output redirection to save data to external files.
